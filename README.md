# Customer Segmentation Using RFM


RFM (recency,frequency,monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has
purchased(receny),how often the purchase(frequency), and how much the customer spends(monetary).


## Problem


 

'Online Retail Data Set', taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository contains information about transactions occurred between 01/12/2009-09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
The company mostly sells all-occasion gifts. Most of the customers are wholesalers.

Calculate the RFM scores and segment customers based on recency and frequency scores to decide which customers are more valuable to improbe  marketing strategies.
